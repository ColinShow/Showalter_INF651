        <h2 id="about-text">
            Cinemalist was created as a final project for my Front End Web Development class.
            It was designed to test my skill with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am really proud with
            how Cinemalist has turned out and I have many future plans to further improve my skill in
            web development.
